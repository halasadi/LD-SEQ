LD-SEQ: Increasing the effective coverage of SEQuencing experiments using Linkage Dis-eqlibrium

Allele frequencies are an important summary statistic in population genetic analyses. However, estimates of allele frequencies are noisy when coverage is low. Our aim is to use LD information (estimated from a haplotype panel) to increases the effective coverage of every SNP. The intuition is that the haplotype panel allows computation of SNP correlations which allows one to borrow information between reads in estimating the frequency of a particular SNP. For example, with two perfectly correlated SNPs, one can utilize information from both SNPs to double the coverage at any one SNP.

In particular, we focus on estimating allele frequencies from ancient individuals, where the data is mostly low coverage.
