LD-SEQ: Increasing the effective coverage of SEQuencing experiments using Linkage Dis-eqlibrium

Allele frequencies are an important summary statistic in population genetic analyses. However, when sequencing experiments are low coverage, the estimates are noisy. Our aim is to use LD information estimated from a haplotype panel to increases the effective coverage. The intuition is that the haplotype panel allows computation of SNP correlations which then allows the use of correlated reads in estimating the frequency of a particular SNP. For example with two perfectly correlated SNPs, one can utilize information from both SNPs to double the coverage at any one SNP.

In particular, we focus on estimating allele frequencies from ancient individuals, where the data is mostly low coverage. We use the 1000 genomes as a reference panel.
