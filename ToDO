(1) Derive the new likelihood function and change document accordingly. (read old document before meeting with Matthew)

(2) Get data from Matheson et al paper: Central_LBNA, LBK_EN, Iberia_Chalcolithic, Bell_Beaker_LN, Anatolia_Neolithic. Get coverage information. Make data such as: UniqueID,  RSID, depth, reads. Need to write a script — consult with David Witonsky

(3) Download covariance matrix from Xiang.

(4) Set up easy test simulations such as two SNPs and a panel of 1000 SNPs. 

(5) Set up test simulations such that:
			(i) Have a true population panel many generation ago. Do Sequencing experiment
      (ii) Drift occurred during those generations  (can you model drift LD — ask Matthew)
      (iii) Set Evolved population as panel.
  
(6) Write R package to implement this new method.

(7) Estimate covariance matrix from Central_LBNA individuals, same as current?

(8) Apply on real data. Use subsampling to check.
