(1) Derive the new likelihood function and change document accordingly. (read old document before meeting with Matthew)

(2) Modeling drift LD

(3) Get data from Matheson et al paper: Central_LBNA, LBK_EN, Iberia_Chalcolithic, Bell_Beaker_LN, Anatolia_Neolithic. Get coverage information. Make data such as: UniqueID,  RSID, depth, reads. Need to write a script — consult with David Witonsky

(4) Set up easy test simulations such as two SNPs and a random panel of 100 SNPs. Talk to Xiang about what you would expect a panel covariance matrix to look like.

(5) Set up test simulations such that:
			(i) Have a true population panel many generation ago. Do Sequencing experiment
      (ii) Drift occurred during those generations  (can you model drift LD — ask Matthew)
      (iii) Set Evolved population as panel.
  
(6) Download 1000 genomes panel and estimate covariance matrix — HARD. Write R package to implement this new method. 

(7) Apply on real data. Use subsampling to check.
